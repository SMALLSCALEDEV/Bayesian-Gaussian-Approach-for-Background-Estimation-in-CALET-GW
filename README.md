# Bayesian-Gaussian-Approach-for-Background-Estimation-in-CALET-GW
The central task in searching for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events is to distinguish transient signals from the variable detector background. This has codes that motivate the use of GPs over traditional approaches, and outline how uncertainties are propagated into detection statistics and upper limits
